Core mechanics
Counter-strafing: To shoot accurately, you must be still. Press the movement key opposite to your direction of travel (e.g., press 'A' to stop moving right) to stop instantly and fire.
Crosshair placement: Always keep your crosshair at head level to minimize the time it takes to get a headshot. This is far more efficient than trying to track an enemy as they run.
Learn spray patterns: Master the first 10 shots of the M4 and AK-47 spray patterns. Knowing how to control your spray is crucial for sustained fire.
Strategy and gameplay
Play with cover: Never be caught in an open area. Use objects and corners to your advantage, and pre-fire common angles if you know an enemy is there and you can't see them directly.
Communicate and coordinate: Use callouts, and communicate with your team to coordinate pushes and retakes. It's better to fight together in a 2v1 than to have two separate 1v1s.
Know your utility: Learn a few basic grenades like smokes, flashes, and molotovs. They are essential for stopping pushes, gaining map control, and creating advantageous situations.
Mindset
Focus on yourself: Don't blame your teammates. Focus on what you could have done better in every situation to improve your own skills.
Patience: Don't always be aggressive. Sometimes, playing passively or holding an angle is the better option.
Practice makes perfect: Use community maps and deathmatch servers to practice your aim and mechanics. Mastering the fundamentals is more important than knowing every single advanced trick.
